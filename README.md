# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Week-3-Project

This R code extracts training and test data from tecxt files and merges them.
Then takes all the variables with mean and standard deviatuion in the title and 
then merges the activity names into the data set.
Then changes the variable names to be more descriptive. i.e. from Acc to Accelerometer.
Finally creates another data set which shows average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
